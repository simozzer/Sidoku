An animated solver for sudoko problems.

Can solve even extremely difficult problems e.g 'Shining Mirror' (though this can take a long time, particularly because of the real-time animation)*

Written using ES6, CSS and HTML.

*Real time animation currently enabled, to change this please set #fast to true (  `https://github.com/simozzer/Sidoku/blob/34814a79cb563d2cb03e4de4d028cdabbd4a4748/sidmain.js#L363 ).

I've been slowly working on improving the performane of this.  The hardest example used to take over 2 minutes on my local machine. I've now got that down to less than 2 seconds.
