#An animated solver for sudoko problems. 

To try this out simply go here: https://simozzer.github.io/Sidoku/

Written using ES6, CSS and HTML.

Can solve even extremely difficult problems e.g 'Shining Mirror' (though this can take a long time, particularly if using real-time animation)*

*Real time animation currently disabled, to change this please set #fast to false (  `https://github.com/simozzer/Sidoku/blob/34814a79cb563d2cb03e4de4d028cdabbd4a4748/sidmain.js#L363 ).


#It's all about the speed: A 24000% speed improvementon my 1st attempt at solving "Shining Mirror".

I've been slowly working on improving the performance of this.  The hardest example used to take over 2 minutes on my local machine. I've now got that down to less than 0.5 seconds.
